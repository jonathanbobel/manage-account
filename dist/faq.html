              <p class="pt-1 mb-4">No. In our continued pursuit of Operational Excellence, we have been striving to offer employees a simple and convenient way to access company and personal information electronically. As the amount of information available to SW employees expands with new web services, it becomes increasingly important to keep this information secure, yet simple for employees to access. To accomplish this task and provide the most convenient experience for our employees, SW issues all employees a standard User ID for logging into company web sites.</p>

The answer you provide, your Challenge Response, will be used as a confirmation if you ever need to reset your password. It is important for you to remember which Challenge Question and the corresponding Challenge Response you select during the registration process. You are the only source for the data you provide. It is only used to reset your password in the event it is forgotten. Please do not share your Challenge Answer and Challenge Response with peers or family members.</p>

               <p class="pt-1 mb-4">All secured web sites have a timeout setting. This means your web session will become invalid after a certain period of inactivity. This is a security precaution so that your account cannot be used if you are away from your computer for a period of time. Depending upon the security of the information presented on each website, the timeout settings will vary. Highly-sensitive websites typically timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity.</p>
